abstract = {This paper studies different signaling techniques on the continuous spectrum (CS) of nonlinear optical fiber defined by nonlinear Fourier transform. Three different signaling techniques are proposed and analyzed based on the statistics of the noise added to CS after propagation along the nonlinear optical fiber. The proposed methods are compared in terms of error performance, distance reach, and complexity. Furthermore, the effect of chromatic dispersion on the data rate and noise in nonlinear spectral domain is investigated. It is demonstrated that, for a given sequence of CS symbols, an optimal bandwidth (or symbol rate) can be determined so that the temporal duration of the propagated signal at the end of the fiber is minimized. In effect, the required guard interval between the subsequently transmitted data packets in time is minimized and the effective data rate is significantly enhanced. Moreover, by selecting the proper signaling method and design criteria a distance reach of 7100 km is reported by only singling on CS at a rate of 9.6 Gbps.},

In this three-part series of papers, this observation is exploited for data transmission over integrable channels, such as optical fibers, where pulse propagation is governed by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. In this transmission scheme, which can be viewed as a nonlinear analogue of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing commonly used in linear channels, information is encoded in the nonlinear frequencies and their spectral amplitudes. Unlike most other fiber-optic transmission schemes, this technique deals with both dispersion and nonlinearity directly and unconditionally without the need for dispersion or nonlinearity compensation methods. This paper explains the mathematical tools that underlie the method.},

@article{Yousefi2014a,
abstract = {Motivated by the looming "capacity crunch" in fiber-optic networks, information transmission over such systems is revisited. Among numerous distortions, inter-channel interference in multiuser wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) is identified as the seemingly intractable factor limiting the achievable rate at high launch power. However, this distortion and similar ones arising from nonlinearity are primarily due to the use of methods suited for linear systems, namely WDM and linear pulse-train transmission, for the nonlinear optical channel. Exploiting the integrability of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation, a nonlinear frequency-division multiplexing (NFDM) scheme is presented, which directly modulates non-interacting signal degrees-of-freedom under NLS propagation. The main distinction between this and previous methods is that NFDM is able to cope with the nonlinearity, and thus, as the the signal power or transmission distance is increased, the new method does not suffer from the deterministic cross-talk between signal components which has degraded the performance of previous approaches. In this paper, emphasis is placed on modulation of the discrete component of the nonlinear Fourier transform of the signal and some simple examples of achievable spectral efficiencies are provided.},

abstract = {For a relatively long optical pulse in a fiber with a dispersion distance z0 much larger than the loss distance, a soliton cannot exist in an ideal sense. However, with a proper choice of the initial amplitude and amplifier distance za, a nonlinear pulse (a guiding-center soliton) propagates like a soliton over a distance much larger than the dispersion distance when it is periodically amplified at distances much shorter than the dispersion distance. The guiding-center soliton is shown to satisfy the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a correction of order (za/z0)2. Numerical examples supported by analytical results are presented for distortionless propagation of the guiding-center solitons with a pulse width of 40 psec in a dispersion-shifted fiber of D $=$ 1 psec/(nm-km).},

abstract = {Polarization-division multiplexed (PDM) transmission based on the nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT) is proposed for optical fiber communication. The NFT algorithms are generalized from the scalar nonlinear Schr\&\#x000F6;dinger equation for one polarization to the Manakov system for two polarizations. The transmission performance of the PDM nonlinear frequency-division multiplexing (NFDM) and PDM orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) are determined. It is shown that the transmission performance in terms of Q-factor is approximately the same in PDM-NFDM and single polarization NFDM at twice the data rate and that the polarization-mode dispersion does not seriously degrade system performance. Compared with PDM-OFDM, PDM-NFDM achieves a Q-factor gain of 6.4 dB. The theory can be generalized to multi-mode fibers in the strong coupling regime, paving the way for the application of the NFT to address the nonlinear effects in space-division multiplexing.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel digital feedforward carrier recovery algorithmfor arbitrary \$M\$-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (\$M\$-QAM) constellations in an intradynecoherent optical receiver. The approach does not contain any feedback loopand is therefore highly tolerant against laser phase noise. This is crucial,especially for higher order QAM constellations, which inherently have a smallerphase noise tolerance due to the lower spacing between adjacent constellationpoints. In addition to the mathematical description of the proposed carrierrecovery algorithm also a possible hardware-efficient implementation in aparallelized system is presented and the performance of the algorithm is evaluatedby Monte Carlo simulations for square 4-QAM (QPSK), 16-QAM, 64-QAM, and 256-QAM.For the simulations ASE noise and laser phase noise are considered as wellas analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and internal resolution effects. Fora 1 dB penalty at \$\{\{\textblackslash\}rmBER\} $=$ 10^\{- 3\}\$, linewidth times symbol duration productsof \$4.1\{\textblackslash\}times 10^\{- 4\}\$ (4-QAM), \$1.4\{\textblackslash\}times10^\{- 4\}\$ (16-QAM), \$4.0\{\textblackslash\}times10^\{- 5\}\$ (64-QAM) and \$8.0\{\textblackslash\}times 10^\{- 6\}\$ (256-QAM) are tolerable.},
